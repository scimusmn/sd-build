# Build scripts for Coast to Cactus exhibit media

Coast to Cactus is a new exhibit for the San Diego Natural History Museum.

These scripts will help us setup and install the various computer based media interactives for the exhibit.

## Tech
These scripts primarily deal with the setup of [node-webkit](https://github.com/rogerwang/node-webkit) and [Meteor](http://www.meteor.com). If you're interested in automating any aspects of these systems these kludged build scripts might be useful for reference.
